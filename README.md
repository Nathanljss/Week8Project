# Week8Project
My week 8 project

This project went pretty well until I tried to display single posts
For some reason I couldnt get them to display on the singular post page no matter what I did (Heinry couldnt figure it out either)

The requirements I did meet: My project displays all the posts in the database on a single page and can be sorted in ascending and descending order (Newest or oldest post first)

I have a database with 2 tables but never learned how to link them with a foreign key or how to create a delete button that removes an entry from the table. I did start implementing a a comment link and a delete post button but I couldnt for the life of me figure out how to get them to waork as intended

Submitting a post will redirect the user to the posts page

Im a bit dissapointed with how this one turned out. Appearance wise Im happy with it as I like the minimalist design of the app but functionality wise I am dissapointed.
